# Where in the World?

This project is a chance for me to build a quiz game featuring capital cities of majot countries in three continents. 

My initial plan was to generate questions with randomly generated options from the array and have radio options attached. 

This was modified for two reasons:
1. I was struggling to consistently get the correct answer being pulled through to increment the score
2. I thought it was also a little too easy with the options presented.

So I altered the overall feel of it changing it to text boxes to increase the difficulty and to allow an easier score calculation
